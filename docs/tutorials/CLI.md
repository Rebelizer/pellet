- `-v` or `--version` will display the pellet version
- `-e` or `--env` environment config file (override common config)
- `--configCommon <path>` path to common config file
- `--configDir <path>` path to config directory
- `--commandDir <path>` path to directory containing additional commands
- `--envWhitelist <string>` environment variable white list separated by ","
- `--scrubLogs <string>` RegExp used to scrub launchDetails and logs
- `--silent` will disable all pellet logging
- `--launchDetails` will print launch and env details
